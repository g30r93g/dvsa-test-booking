# DVSA Test Booking

After months of stories about how the DVSA is unable to
curb driving instructors purchasing tests without
students' knowledge and selling those slots on at a
profit, I have created this as a proof-of-concept as to
how I believe this can best be tackled.

## Process

1. Tests can only be booked once you have completed your theory.
2. Learner creates an account in this portal with the theory test pass number.
3. Learner can then nominate an instructor to manage their practical test booking.
4. Instructors and learners put their availability into the system
5. Instructor/learner books a test. If instructor books a test, learner must confirm within 24 hours.
6. Any tests that are to be made available are put on a "cancellations" list where instructors and learners can select available slots. If instructor is the one booking, it must be assigned to a student and the student must confirm within 24 hours of the booking.

By doing this, the instructor is unable to act of their own accord and ensures learner drivers are fully aware of the activity their account has.
